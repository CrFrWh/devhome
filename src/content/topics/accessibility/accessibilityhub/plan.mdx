## Plan

Hub website that contains information for devs how to meet Accessiblity standard WCAG/EAA

Basic guides etc on how to meet different areas

How to go further, make your app more Accessible compared to others

NPM dev package to work with Huskey on pre-commit to scan commit docs

VS extension to intellisence/review changes in files

Chrome extension to enable specific Accessiblity related settings. E.g. overlay a blur for people with poor sight, colour blindness etc

Console app where you enter a URL and it provides how Accessible the linked doc is

Fold the ESLint/TS ruleset and Storybook a11y stories into the npm package as optional plugins.
Ship a GitHub Action alongside the CLI scanner for easy CI adoption.
Extend the Chrome extension with a “record impairments profile” that can be shared with teammates.
Add a design-token auditor mode to the CLI (reads a config or CSS vars, emits contrast matrix).

Add hub sections: “by role,” “by phase,” and “by platform.”
Ship GitHub Action + SARIF output with the CLI scanner.
Extend the Chrome extension with sharable impairment profiles.
Add the design-token auditor mode to the CLI (contrast matrix).
Start a VS Code extension stub: inline lint + contrast checker.
Publish Storybook a11y stories and an ESLint config in the npm package.
Draft the role-based checklists and a “fix-it” cookbook page on the hub.
