Console app that takes a URL as a parameter for a web page. The console app scans that page and returns a list of Accessiblity/UX issues and potential solutions.

It also rates the level of the issue and also what WCAG etc it relates to

Input (URL) -> Fetch HTML -> Parse DOM -> Run Rule Engine -> Aggregate Issues -> Format Output -> Display/Save

Potential Packages to use:
[cheeriojs](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio)

[css-selector-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/css-selector-parser)

## Plan

Level of rules, WCAG level based. Set it then retains that for that session unless changed.

- Error handling

### Phase 2

- Report generation
- Configuration file support (.a11yrc)
- CI/changed
- Color contract detection

### Phase 3

- JS event handler detection
- Dynamic content analysis
- Browser automation (headless Chrome)
- AI-powered suggestions
