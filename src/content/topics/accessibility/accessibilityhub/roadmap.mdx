## Roadmap (prioritized)

**Weeks 0–2: Launch essentials**

- Add hub navigation “by role,” “by phase,” “by platform.”
- Publish “fix-it” cookbook (top 10 issues: labels, headings, alt, contrast, focus, forms).
- NPM package v0: Husky pre-commit a11y checks + ESLint a11y rules + Storybook a11y addon docs.
- CLI/URL scanner v0: core WCAG rules, console + JSON, deterministic exit codes.

**Weeks 2–4: CI + empathy**

- GitHub Action wrapper for CLI scanner with SARIF output.
- Chrome extension presets for impairments (blur, color blindness variants, reduced motion, dyslexia font).
- Hub quickstarts + short GIF demos for each subproject.

**Weeks 4–8: Depth and design coverage**

- CLI design-token auditor (contrast matrix from CSS vars/config).
- VS Code extension stub: inline lint + contrast checker on selected colors.
- Storybook pack: keyboard stories, ARIA snippets, announceable components.
- Figma/Sketch plugin v0: contrast checks + prefers-reduced-motion preview.

**Weeks 8–12: Dynamic + mobile**

- Headless Playwright + axe-core journeys; keyboard-only crawl for focus traps.
- Visual regression “a11y lens”: high-contrast and 200% zoom snapshots.
- Mobile presets: React Native/Flutter lint rules + sample app with accessibility props.

**12+ weeks: Operational excellence**

- Privacy-safe runtime beacon for missing labels/focus traps sampling in prod.
- AI triage to dedupe findings and suggest fixes with code snippets.
- Screen-reader outline generator to show how pages are announced.

**Ongoing**

- Role-based checklists (Design, Dev, QA, PM) and platform tracks (Web, Mobile).
- “Hello world” + demo clip for every subproject.
- WCAG mapping matrix for every rule/report.
