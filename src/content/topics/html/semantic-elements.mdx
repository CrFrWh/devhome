## Semantic Elements

A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

Examples of non-semantic elements: `<div> and <span>`- Tells nothing about its content.

Examples of semantic elements: `<img>,<table>, and <article>` - Clearly defines its content.

Another example is the hgroup element, representing a heading and related content. The element may be used to group an h1–h6 element with one or more p elements containing content representing a subheading, alternative title, or tagline.

[hgroup html
spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/sections.html#the-hgroup-element)

### Example

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>My Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <hgroup>
      <h1>The reality dysfunction</h1>
      <p>Space is not the only void</p>
    </hgroup>
    <div>
      <h1>Page Heading ungroupped</h1>
      <p>Page details ungroupped</p>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

Using a div achieves a similar result as the hgroup but using the hgroup both tells the browser and users what specifically the element is. Two elements could be in a div but not directly related.
